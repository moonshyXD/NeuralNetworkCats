This program is used to detect cats in photos. The code outputs the probability of a cat being shown in the photo and draws a green bounding box if YES and NO otherwise.
For the program to work correctly, you need to install the OpenCV library in your project and configure it accordingly. 
The main methods for processing and reading messages occur in the ImageProcessor class, while the neural network is encapsulated in the Network class.
